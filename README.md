I’m a researcher in computational cognitive neuroscience at Inria and the Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases (Bordeaux, France). I’m investigating decision making, learning and cognition using computational models of the brain and distributed, numerical and adaptive computing, a.k.a. artificial neural networks and machine learning. My research aims to irrigate the fields of philosophy with regard to the mind-body problem, medicine to account for the normal and pathological functioning of the brain and the digital sciences to offer alternative computing paradigms. Beside neuroscience and philosophy, I’m also interested in open and reproducible science (I’ve co-founded [ReScience C](https://github.com/ReScience) with Konrad Hinsen and wrote the article [Transforming Code into Scientific Contribution](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full)), scientific visualization (I’ve created [glumpy](https://glumpy.github.io/), co-created [VisPy](http://vispy.org/) and authored the popular [Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833)), Science outreach (e.g. [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/why-your-cat-is-lousy-at-chess-yet-way-smarter-than-even-the-most-advanced-ai-125581) and computer graphics (especially [digital typography](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3214834.3214837)). I'm also writing books when I've time:

[**From Python to Numpy**](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/), Nicolas P. Rougier

An open-source book about numpy vectorization techniques, based on experience, practice and descriptive examples.

[**Scientific Visualization – Python & Matplotlib**](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book), Nicolas P. Rougier

An open access book on scientific visualization using python and matplotlib to be released in 2020 (hopefully). You can support the book by [tipping (25 €)](https://www.paypal.me/NicolasPRougier/25) or [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/rougier) through GitHub sponsorship program. Both option gves you access to the private repository while the book is being written.
