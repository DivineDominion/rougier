  I’m a researcher in computational cognitive neuroscience at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/">Inria</a> and the
<a href="http://www.imn-bordeaux.org/en/">Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases</a> (Bordeaux, France). I’m investigating
decision making, learning and cognition using computational models of the brain
and distributed, numerical and adaptive computing, a.k.a. artificial neural
networks and machine learning. My research aims to irrigate the fields of
philosophy with regard to the mind-body problem, medicine to account for the
normal and pathological functioning of the brain and the digital sciences to
offer alternative computing paradigms.</p>

<p align="justify">
Beside neuroscience and philosophy, I’m also interested in open and
reproducible science (I’ve co-founded <a href="https://rescience.github.io">ReScience C</a> with <a href="http://khinsen.net/">Konrad Hinsen</a> and
wrote the article <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full">Transforming Code into Scientific Contribution</a>), scientific
visualization (I’ve created <a href="https://glumpy.github.io">glumpy</a>, co-created <a href="http://vispy.org">VisPy</a> and authored the
popular <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833">Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures</a> article), Science outreach
(e.g. <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-your-cat-is-lousy-at-chess-yet-way-smarter-than-even-the-most-advanced-ai-125581">
Why your cat is lousy at chess?</a>) and computer graphics (especially <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/NicolasRougier1/siggraph-2018-digital-typography">digital
typography</a>).</p>

[**From Python to Numpy**](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/) A book on Numpy concentrating on the migration from Python to Numpy through vectorization. There are a lot of techniques that you don't find in books and such techniques are mostly learned through experience. The goal of this book is to explain some of these techniques and to provide an opportunity for making this experience in the process.
